# Group definitions go here. A server is either a master or a minion.
# 	master:   Master hosts will go here (although it's possible to have more than one master...that functionality isn't supported at this time)
# 	minion:   Servers in this group will be placed in the "small" district
# 	hub:      OPTIONAL: Hub is where you'll host a local docker registry
# 
# The "standard" ansible syntax applies here. Which means you can have ranges and wildcards.
# 	Ex:
# 		minion[01:09].example.com
# 		minion*.example.com
#
##

# Master group
[master]
master.example.net

# Minion group
[minion]
minion[01:02].example.net

[hub]
