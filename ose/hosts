# Group definitions go here. A server is either a broker or a node. Depending on what kind of node profile you want; put your host[s] in the proper group
# 	broker: Broker hosts will go here (although it's possible to have more than one broker...that functionality isn't supported at this time)
# 	node-small:   Servers in this group will be placed in the "small" district
# 	node-medium:  Servers in this group will be placed in the "medium" district
# 	node-large:   Servers in this group will be placed in the "large" district
# 	node-xpaas:   Servers in this group will be placed in the "xpaas" district and fuse will be installed
# 
# The "standard" ansible syntax applies here. Which means you can have ranges and wildcards.
# 	Ex:
# 		node[01:09].example.com
# 		node*.example.com
