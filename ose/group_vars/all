# This is the main OSE Ansible configuration file. Editing this file will configure your OSE installation. 
# Although you can put variables elsewhere (and they might work)...there really shoudln't be a need to do so

# It's worth noting that these can be overwritten at playbook runtime with the "-e" option (multiple times for more than one variable).
# 	example:
# 	  ansible-playbook ose.yml -i hosts -e 'rhn_os1_host="true"' -e 'ose_domain=ose.mydomain.com' [ other options] -f 10

#
## The rh_os1_host setting is specific to OS1 and there is no need to change the default unless you're deploying to OS1 (those who need to know what OS1 is already know)
##	Valid Values: "true" or "false"
rh_os1_host: "false"

#
## The rhsm_username and rhsm_password settings are for your Red Hat subscription credentials. You should probably pass these at run time with "-e" but you can use it in this file if you choose so.
rhsm_username: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
rhsm_password: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#
## The ose_domain and ose_host_domain are domains that have-been/will-be delegated to the broker. It is possible that these two configurations are the same but they don't have to be:
##	example:
##	  ose_domain: ose.example.com
##	  ose_host_domain: ose.example.com
##	OR
##	  ose_domain: ose.example.com
##	  ose_host_domain: hosts.example.com
##
## Configuration will depend on your settings:
ose_domain: ose.example.net
ose_host_domain: ose.example.net

#
## The broker_name is the FQDN of the broker host. The dnsip is usually the ip address of the broker
broker_name: broker.ose.example.net
dnsip: 172.16.1.220

#
## For console_user and console_user_password is the username/password to login to the web console and is usually used for the demoing. Best practice is to remove the entry and create new users
console_user: demo
console_user_password: 7677aa8e409c47b9a826a52cd145f739

#
## The mcollective_password is the credentials needed for communication. 
## You can generate a random password like this:
##	user@host$ uuidgen | sed -e 's/-//g'
## 
## Of course, you don't HAVE to randomly generate it...but it *is* best practice
mcollective_password: 7677aa8e409c47b9a826a52cd145f739

#
## valid_gear_sizes are used to tell the broker what gear sized are valid. You can specify more than one if you seperate them with a comma
## 	Valid Configs Are: small, medium, large, and xpaas
##	Ex:
##	  valid_gear_sizes: "small"
##	OR
##	  valid_gear_sizes: "small,medium,large,xpaas"
valid_gear_sizes: "small,medium,xpaas"

#
## dns_entries are entries that will be entered into the brokers DNS server. They are keyvalue pairs with colons; each keyvalue pair is separated by a comma
##	Ex:
##	  dns_entries: "broker:192.168.1.10,activemq:192.168.1.10,node01:192.168.1.11
## 
## Note that you can reference other variables by using {{ var }} ...at minimum you need 1 broker, 1 activemq, and one node entry
dns_entries: "broker:{{ dnsip }},activemq:{{ dnsip }},node1:172.16.1.221"

#
## If you would like to have the broker to automatically create districts for you; set default_post_deploy to "true". If this is set to false; you need to 
## specify you district mappings
default_post_deploy: "false"

#
## If you set default_post_deploy: "false" then you will need to  map your districts. They are keyvalue pairs each district is separated by a semicolon.
## 	Ex:
##	  district_mappings: "small:node1.ose.example.net,node2.ose.example.net;medium:node3.ose.example.net,node4.ose.example.net"
district_mappings: "small:node1.ose.example.net,node2.ose.example.net;medium:node3.ose.example.net,node4.ose.example.net"

#
## Don't change these values. Bug in current version makes this not work if changed or removed
ose_script: /usr/local/src/openshift.sh
ose_script_log: /usr/local/src/openshift.sh.inst.log
nodename: "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
